Resources
---------

* iTunes University - `Developing iOS 8 Applications with Swift  <https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099>`_  -- This is a great resource, Prof. Hegarty is an expert.  His lectures are great and very accessible.  You will watch his lectures and demonstrations outside of class.  If you have an iOS device I recommend you subscribe to this course.
* XCode - Although the course uses iOS 8, and XCode 6 we will use the latest version and adapt.
* `The Swift Programming Language <https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11>`_
* `Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C <https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/using-swift-cocoa-objective/id888894773?mt=11>`_

Flipped Classroom
-----------------
If you are not familiar with the idea of the flipped classroom, it is this.  You will watch lectures on video on your own time, and we will use classroom time for discussing your questions, as well as working on projects.

The lectures are available on iTunes U

* iTunes U videos by Dr. Paul Hegarty

I will not recite the same information covered in the video lectures during class.  You are responsible for watching the lectures and bringing questions or ideas of small programs to try with you to class.

Class Attendance is **mandatory**, yes its at 8:00, bring coffee or whatever you need.

On days when you are to have watched a video before class I will be looking for you to post a question.  You can either post it publicly or DM it to me and I will repost.
