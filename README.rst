Resources
---------

* iTunes University - `Developing iOS 8 Applications with Swift  <https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099>`_  -- This is a great resource, Prof. Hegarty is an expert.  His lectures are great and very accessible.  You will watch his lectures and demonstrations outside of class.  If you have an iOS device I recommend you subscribe to this course.
* XCode - Although the course uses iOS 8, and XCode 6 we will use the latest version and adapt.
* `The Swift Programming Language <https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11>`_
* `Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C <https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/using-swift-cocoa-objective/id888894773?mt=11>`_

Flipped Classroom
-----------------
If you are not familiar with the idea of the flipped classroom, it is this.  You will watch lectures on video on your own time, and we will use classroom time for discussing your questions, as well as working on projects.

The lectures are available on iTunes U

* iTunes U videos by Dr. Paul Hegarty

I will not recite the same information covered in the video lectures during class.  You are responsible for watching the lectures and bringing questions or ideas of small programs to try with you to class.

Class Attendance is **mandatory**, yes its at 8:00, bring coffee or whatever you need.

On days when you are to have watched a video before class I will be looking for you to post a question.  You can either post it publicly or DM it to me and I will repost.

Tentative Schedule -- Spring 2016
---------------------------------

* Feb 4 -- Intro, Trying out Swift
    * `Swift Quick Start <http://www.raywenderlich.com/115253/swift-2-tutorial-a-quick-start>`_

* Feb 9 -- Watch Lecture 1, Typing in Calculator in class
    * In class today we will look at some solutions to the anagram detector homework problem I assigned.  Paste your solution into the Slack #homework channel   Use three backticks at the top and bottom of your post so that the code will look like code. like this::

        ```
        func myfunc(a:String, b:String) -> Bool
            do stuff
            return something
        ```

    * After looking at and discussing some of the solutions we will work on the first part of the calculator and probably start on the second from the lecture for the 11th.

* Feb 11 -- Watch Lecture 2, Typing in Calculator in class
    * We should be able to finish up the in-class part of the calculator project today.

Grading
-------

Grading will be based on your canned projects and your final own final project that you will demo to me during finals.

**If** it becomes apparent to me that you are not watching the videos and keeping up then I will add in a **Quiz** component to the grade, and I will make up quizzes on the lectures.
